## Troubleshooting
1. Check TYPO3 logs (`/var/logs/typo3_*.log`) for any errors related to the extension.
2. Make sure you have a valid [Google API key] with Maps JavaScript API and Places API enabled in the Google Cloud .
3. Make sure that billing is enabled for your Google Cloud project, as the Places API requires billing to be active.
4. Make sure you have included the static TypoScript from the extension in your site package or in the Template record of your TYPO3 site.
5. In you include extension "setup.typoscript" file directly in your site package, make sure you have included the "constants.typoscript" file as well, otherwise the extension will not work properly.
6. Check if selected/used Place ID is correct and corresponds to a valid Google business location. [Find ID](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/place-id).
7. Check the "Application restrictions" section for the API key configs in your Google Cloud Console. Application restrictions limit an API keyâ€™s usage to specific websites, IP addresses, Android applications, or iOS applications. You can set one application restriction per key.
